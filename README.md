✅Facebook Bug Report Documentation
This task involved identifying and documenting two distinct bugs in the Facebook mobile application (v517.0.0.42.97):
- UI Bug – Notification Order
- Notifications are not listed in proper chronological order, resulting in a confusing user experience.
- Functional Bug – Post Editing
- The “Edit Post” feature fails to save changes, even after the user taps “Save.”
Each bug was recorded with clear reproduction steps, expected vs. actual outcomes, and supporting screenshots via Google Drive links. The task demonstrates practical QA skills in manual testing, detailed bug documentation, and user-centric validation.
